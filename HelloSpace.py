# Taking a look at variables

planet = "Mars"         # Define variable planet to mars

print("Hello", planet); # Call planet variable(mars) and append it to "Hello"
print("Bye", planet);   # Call planet variable(mars) and append it to "Bye"

planet = "Saturn";      # Redefine planet variable to Saturn

print("Hello", planet); # Redo line 5 but with planet set as Saturn
print("Bye", planet);   # Redo line 6 but with planet set as Saturn
